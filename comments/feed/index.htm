					<description><![CDATA[I strongly agree with the article on why you must hire an interior designer before a builder. From my experience, involving an interior designer ensures the cohesive design, optimal space planning, and seamless integration of aesthetics and functionality. I recommend hiring an interior designer first to achieve your desired vision and avoid costly mistakes.]]></description>
