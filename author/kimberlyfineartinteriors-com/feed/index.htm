<p>In the past, laundry rooms were often relegated to the basement or tucked away in a corner, purely functional spaces with little thought given to design or convenience. Today, however, these spaces have undergone a significant transformation. The modern laundry room is now considered integral parts of the home, seamlessly blending cutting-edge technology, utility, and high-end design aesthetics.</p>



<p>The evolution of laundry rooms reflects a broader trend in home design: the desire to combine functionality with luxury. As homeowners seek to create spaces that meet their practical needs and provide a touch of elegance and convenience, the laundry room has emerged as a critical area of focus. Having a modern laundry room has become a symbol of sophistication and efficiency by integrating smart appliances, stylish storage solutions, and innovative design elements. This blog post will explore how technology and thoughtful design create these luxurious, functional spaces.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What’s a Modern Luxury Laundry Room?</h2>



<p>A <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/terriwilliams/2024/03/11/how-to-incorporate-the-2024-laundry-room-trends-in-your-home/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">luxury modern laundry room</a> is more than just a place to wash and dry clothes; it is a space that combines high-end appliances and thoughtful design to create a seamless blend of functionality and elegance, enjoying the latest technology at home.</p>



<p>There is a noticeable shift towards integrating living spaces with laundry areas in contemporary homes. Homeowners are incorporating high-end technology like TVs, and sound systems, that they can enjoy on comfortable seating in their laundry rooms. This shift is transforming the modern laundry room into multifunctional spaces where one can relax or enjoy entertainment while handling household chores.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Technology and Design as Key Elements</h3>



<p>The transformation of laundry rooms into luxurious spaces hinges on the crucial roles of cutting-edge advancements and thoughtful design. Advanced washing machines and dryers now come with features like steam functions, which help remove stubborn stains and sanitize clothes, large capacities to handle more oversized loads, and quiet operation for a more peaceful home environment. Smart home connectivity allows users to control and monitor their laundry appliances remotely, adding a layer of convenience and efficiency to their daily routines.<br><br>Brands such as Miele, Bosch, LG, and Whirlpool are at the forefront of this technological revolution, offering models like the <a href="https://www.lg.com/us/washers-dryers/lg-wm4000hwa-front-load-washer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">LG Smart Wi-Fi Enabled Front Load Washer &amp; Dryer</a>, which is easy to access and offers efficient washing and drying times. There’s also the <a href="https://www.electrolux.com/en/p/laundry-care/washers/front-load-washers/ELFW7637AT" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Electrolux Smartboost Front-Load Washer</a> &amp; <a href="https://www.electrolux.com/en/p/laundry-care/dryers/ELFE7637AT">Stackable Electric Dryer</a>, which boasts intuitive controls and an accurate auto-sensing dry cycle. <br><br>These appliances don&#8217;t just serve a purpose; they are crafted to elevate the home&#8217;s decor. They enrich the modern laundry room&#8217;s aesthetic appeal and functionality with elegant finishes and cutting-edge features.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Contemporary Laundry Room Ideas</h3>



<p>Contemporary luxury laundry rooms can have various design themes, depending on individual preferences and the home&#8217;s overall aesthetic. Some popular contemporary laundry room ideas include:</p>



<p><strong>Sleek and minimalistic</strong>: This style features clean lines, neutral colors, and a clutter-free space. The focus is on efficiency and functionality.</p>



<p><strong>Industrial chic</strong>: This design incorporates elements like exposed pipes, metal accents, and raw materials to create a modern yet industrial look.</p>



<p><strong>Bold and bright</strong>: For those who enjoy color, a bold, bright laundry room can inject energy into an otherwise mundane chore. Think vibrant walls, patterned flooring, and fun decor pieces.</p>



<p>Space optimization is a crucial consideration in luxury laundry rooms. Utilizing vertical space with wall-mounted cabinets and shelves, incorporating pull-out hampers, and using stackable appliances are effective ways to maximize efficiency. Natural light is another critical element, making the room more open and welcoming. Premium materials such as marble countertops, high-quality cabinetry, and designer tiles add a touch of elegance and durability to the space.</p>



<p>Practical storage solutions are crucial for upholding a clutter-free and refined aesthetic. Custom cabinetry, hidden storage compartments, and sleek appliances help create a streamlined appearance, ensuring the laundry room is serviceable and attractive.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="768" src="https://fineartinteriors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Luxury-laundry-rooms-stackable-appliances-Tuscon-AZ-1024x768.png" alt="" class="wp-image-9227" srcset="https://fineartinteriors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Luxury-laundry-rooms-stackable-appliances-Tuscon-AZ-1024x768.png 1024w, https://fineartinteriors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Luxury-laundry-rooms-stackable-appliances-Tuscon-AZ-300x225.png 300w, https://fineartinteriors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Luxury-laundry-rooms-stackable-appliances-Tuscon-AZ-768x576.png 768w, https://fineartinteriors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Luxury-laundry-rooms-stackable-appliances-Tuscon-AZ.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Modern Stacked Laundry Room Ideas</h3>



<p><a href="https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/appliances/washer-reviews/g44623615/best-stackable-washer-dryer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stacked laundry systems</a> are an excellent solution for conserving space in homes where floor space is at a premium. These systems involve placing the dryer on top of the washing machine, freeing up valuable floor space for other uses. Stacked systems are practical and efficient, offering the same advanced features as their side-by-side counterparts while occupying half the space. </p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Design Tips for Stacked Systems</h4>



<p>When incorporating a stackable washer and dryer like the <a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/home-appliances/washers/stacked-washer-and-dryer/bespoke-4-6-cu-ft-ai-laundry-hub-large-capacity-single-unit-washer-with-flex-auto-dispense-system-and-7-6-cu-ft-electric-dryer-in-brushed-black-wh46dbh500eva3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Samsung AI Laundry Hub<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></a> into your home, ergonomic placement is crucial to facilitate ease of use. Ensure that controls and access doors are comfortable to avoid strain and make laundry tasks more convenient. Custom cabinetry or built-in enclosures can help integrate these appliances seamlessly into the design of your home, hiding them when not in use and maintaining a clean, sophisticated look.</p>



<p>When considering a stackable washer and dryer system, the homeowner must ensure that the water supply lines for both hot and cold water are easily accessible and properly located for the stackable unit. In addition, proper ventilation for the dryer is necessary. A stackable dryer needs a vent that allows for adequate airflow to the outside of the house.&nbsp;</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Stacked Systems for Large Families and Pet Owners</h4>



<p>Managing large volumes of laundry efficiently is a top priority for large families or households with pets. Stacked systems can be particularly beneficial in these situations, offering the capacity and functionality needed to keep up with the demands of a busy household.</p>



<p>Using two sets of stacked washers and dryers can further enhance efficiency, allowing for simultaneous washing and drying of multiple loads. This arrangement is especially useful for keeping pet items separate from regular family laundry, maintaining hygiene, and preventing cross-contamination.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Seamless Integration into Home Aesthetics</h4>



<p>Integrating stacked laundry systems into your home&#8217;s overall aesthetic requires careful planning and innovative design solutions. Designer cabinets and built-in enclosures can help hide appliances when not in use, ensuring they do not detract from the room’s visual appeal. Alternatively, choosing appliances with sleek, modern designs can make them a visually appealing part of your home decor.</p>



<p>Examples of innovative design solutions include concealing the laundry area with <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/laundry-room-door-ideas-7095121" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sliding doors or panels</a>, incorporating open shelving for <a href="https://www.bhg.com/laundry-room-shelving-ideas-6832980" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stylish storage of laundry essentials</a>, and enhancing the space with decorative elements like plants or artwork. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Using Modern Technology for Laundry Rooms</h2>



<p>The latest technological advancements in laundry appliances have revolutionized how we approach laundry tasks, transforming the laundry room into a hub of functionality and luxury. From smart home integration to innovative features like steam closets and Wi-Fi-enabled washers and dryers, these technologies enhance convenience, efficiency, and the overall user experience, making laundry chores more manageable and even enjoyable.</p>



<p><strong>Smart Home Integration</strong>: One of the most meaningful advancements in high-end modern laundry rooms is its integration into smart homes. Automated systems that control temperature, humidity, and lighting can create an optimal environment for laundry tasks, while <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-smart-washer-and-dryer-4159824" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">smart washers and dryers</a> can be controlled via smartphone, adding a layer of modern luxury and convenience.Picture being able to start a load of laundry from your office or getting a notification on your phone when it&#8217;s time to fold your clothes. This level of connectivity streamlines household chores and integrates seamlessly into a connected home ecosystem. Additionally, custom cabinetry can be designed to hide iRobot vacuums and docking stations, maintaining the room&#8217;s sleek and organized appearance.</p>

<p><strong>Steam Closet</strong>: A <a href="https://reviewed.usatoday.com/laundry/features/3-steam-closets-can-reduce-your-dry-cleaning-bill" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">steam closet</a> is a sophisticated addition to any luxury laundry room, offering unparalleled garment care. These closets use steam to refresh, sanitize, and de-wrinkle clothes, providing a gentle and efficient alternative to traditional ironing. By circulating steam through the fibers of the garments, steam closets effectively remove odors, bacteria, and allergens, leaving clothes fresh and clean. Popular models of steam closets include the LG Styler and the <a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/home-appliances/air-dresser/air-dresser/airdresser-grand-clothing-care-system-with-steam-refresh-and-sanitize-in-mirror-finish-df10a9500cg-a1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Samsung AirDresser</a>.</p>



<p>Steam closets are particularly beneficial for delicate fabrics that require special care, such as silk, wool, and cashmere. In a high-end laundry room, a steam closet elevates its functionality and imbues it with a sense of sophistication, guaranteeing optimal care for your garments.</p>



<p><strong>Wi-Fi Enabled Washers and Dryers: </strong>Wi-Fi-enabled washers and dryers are at the forefront of smart home tech, offering features like remote control operation, usage tracking, and maintenance alerts. These appliances empower users to conveniently manage and monitor their laundry remotely via smartphones or other devices, offering unmatched convenience and efficiency. For instance, you can start a wash cycle on your way home from work or receive a notification when the dryer cycle is complete, making laundry tasks more manageable.</p>



<p>Some of the more well-known models are the <a href="https://www.lg.com/us/washers-dryers/lg-wkex200hba-washtower" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GE Profile Smart Top-Load Washer with Smarter Wash Technology</a> and the <a href="https://www.lg.com/us/washers-dryers/lg-wkex200hba-washtower">LG Smart Front-Load Washer and Gas Dryer WashTower.</a></p>



<p><strong>Self-Cleaning Washers</strong>: Self-cleaning washers represent a significant advancement in laundry innovation, addressing common issues like mold, mildew, and unpleasant odors. These washers use advanced cleaning cycles to remove detergent residue, bacteria, and other build-ups from the drum and internal components, ensuring optimal hygiene and performance.</p>



<p>The benefits of self-cleaning features are manifold. They reduce maintenance time, improve the washer&#8217;s efficiency, and eliminate the common problems associated with traditional washing machines. This feature offers homeowners peace of mind and convenience, knowing that their appliances are kept clean and functioning at their best with minimal effort.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some notable self-cleaning washers are the <a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/home-appliances/washers/front-load/4-5-cu-ft-front-load-washer-with-vibration-reduction-technology-in-black-stainless-steel-wf45t6000av-a5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Samsung Self-Clean+ Technology</a>, <a href="https://www.lg.com/us/washers-dryers/lg-wm5500hwa-front-load-washer" rel="nofollow">LG TurboWash 360°</a>, and the <a href="https://www.geappliances.com/appliance/GE-Profile-5-3-cu-ft-Capacity-Smart-Front-Load-ENERGY-STAR-Steam-Washer-with-Adaptive-SmartDispense-UltraFresh-Vent-System-Plus-with-OdorBlock-PFW950SPTDS" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GE SmartDispense Technology</a>.</p>

<p></p>



<p>When designing or renovating your home, selecting a suitable kitchen countertop surface is a pivotal decision. The kitchen isn’t merely a backdrop for culinary escapades or casual family gatherings; it’s a canvas that reflects your home’s personality and lifestyle. The role of countertops in kitchen design transcends the utilitarian into the realm of artistry, where practicality meets form and durability embraces design.</p>



<p>However, aesthetics is just one facet. In addition to its usefulness, it is imperative to ensure that the surface can withstand the demands of the kitchen. Sustainability is another consideration as homeowners seek to reduce environmental impact. Longevity and low maintenance are key factors as countertops endure daily wear and tear. A countertop that looks inviting a decade from now is a testament to thoughtful craftsmanship and a wise investment.</p>



<p>In this article, we will tackle the best countertop surfaces for a kitchen, unique countertop ideas, and even some high-end countertop choices—from the classic allure of natural stone to modern kitchen counters and sustainable materials that have emerged.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What Is the Best Kitchen Countertop for My Home?</h2>



<p>Determining the best kitchen countertop for your home requires introspection and a close examination of your lifestyle and household&#8217;s unique rhythms and needs.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Assessing Your Kitchen&#8217;s Needs</h3>



<p>Before falling in love with a material based on looks alone, take stock of your kitchen&#8217;s operational requirements. <br><br>Durability and ease of maintenance might top the list for homes with young children or large families. Surfaces that can handle spills, resist stains, and are forgiving of dropped pans are invaluable in these busy environments. Think also about the edges of the countertop; rounded corners might be safer for toddlers, while more defined edges could suit a child-free home.<br><br>For those who love to cook, materials that can take the heat are ideal. For bakers, quartzite countertops are naturally heat-resistant, making it safe to place hot pans or trays directly on the surface without fear of damage.<br><br>If your kitchen often serves as a place for guests to gather and socialize, you might consider materials like quartzite or polished concrete, which provide a stunning visual anchor and can withstand the occasional red wine spill with aplomb.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://fineartinteriors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Mirror-1-1024x683.jpg" alt="Countertops in dining room of Chi Omega House in Tuscon, AZ" class="wp-image-9176" srcset="https://fineartinteriors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Mirror-1-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://fineartinteriors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Mirror-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://fineartinteriors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Mirror-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://fineartinteriors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Mirror-1-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://fineartinteriors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Mirror-1-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://fineartinteriors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Mirror-1-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Matching Countertops to Your Home&#8217;s Overall Design</h3>



<p>Matching your kitchen countertop to your home&#8217;s overall design is essential for creating a cohesive and harmonious interior.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In contemporary kitchens, clean lines and a sleek aesthetic are often the guiding principles. Modern kitchen counters with minimal veining or solid colors suit this style well.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Traditional kitchens are all about warmth and classic elegance. Materials that echo these sentiments, such as granite or wood, are ideal choices. Mixing wood and granite countertops in the same kitchen is a design strategy that combines the warmth and natural beauty of wood with the elegance and durability of granite. This approach allows homeowners to enjoy the best of both materials, creating a kitchen that is not only functional but also rich in texture and visual interest.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Modern kitchen designs often blend the sleekness of contemporary styles with a bit of warmth, creating a comfortable yet chic space. Quartz and quartzite countertops are fantastic options for modern themes, offering the perfect mix of sophistication and utility.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Environmental Considerations</h3>



<p>Understanding the ecological footprint of each material is key to making an informed decision that aligns with your environmental values.</p>



<p>Many traditional countertop materials, such as <a href="https://usenaturalstone.org/pros-cons-granite-countertops/">granite</a>, require quarrying. Once quarried, only minimal processing is necessary to prepare it for use in the kitchen.</p>



<p>Engineered stones like quartz also require consideration. The manufacturing process involves mining the natural stone and combining it with resins and other synthetic materials, often requiring significant energy consumption. However, some quartz manufacturers are <a href="https://www.azuremagazine.com/article/caesarstone-sustainable-quartz-countertops/">taking steps</a> to reduce their carbon footprint by utilizing recycled materials and adopting more sustainable production methods.</p>



<p>Concrete countertops not only offer a <a href="https://www.concrete-worktops.com/post/concrete-worktops-sustainability">sustainable edge</a> in design with their ability to incorporate recycled materials like glass, slag cement, or fly ash but also stand out for their robust durability and functional versatility. Favored for their clean lines and unpretentious aesthetic, concrete surfaces are a staple in many designs, particularly for dining table tops and bathroom countertops.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Their appeal extends to family-friendly environments, where a virtually indestructible surface is paramount. Concrete&#8217;s resilience is enhanced when sealed with an outdoor sealer, making it even more durable against the rigors of daily use and capable of withstanding high temperatures without warping. Its ability to be locally sourced and fabricated, combined with its low maintenance and high durability, positions concrete countertops as an environmentally and functionally superior choice for modern design needs.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Budget Considerations</h3>



<p>Budget considerations are paramount when selecting a kitchen countertop, as the cost can vary widely based on material, installation, and maintenance requirements.</p>



<p>The cost of kitchen countertops is influenced by the type of material and the complexity of the installation. Materials like <a href="https://www.bhg.com/kitchen/countertop/budget-friendly-countertop-options/">laminate or tile</a> can offer significant savings and are excellent for those on a strict budget. Mid-range materials such as solid surfaces and some types of <a href="https://www.architecturaldigest.com/reviews/home-improvement/cost-of-granite-countertops">granite</a> offer a balance between affordability and durability. For high-end countertop choices, materials like <a href="https://www.hgtv.com/design/remodel/kitchen-remodel/which-countertops-are-most-expensive#:~:text=Marble%20tops%20the%20most%2Dexpensive,maintenance%20to%20ensure%20its%20legacy.">marble, quartzite, and concrete</a> are investment pieces. They bring a luxurious look and feel to your kitchen and are more durable.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When considering resale value, think of the appeal that your countertops will have to potential buyers. Given its central role in home and family life, the kitchen&#8217;s appeal can significantly influence the buying decision. It represents a blend of functionality, style, and the potential for familial warmth and hospitality. For many buyers, the kitchen&#8217;s condition and design can tip the scales, making it a critical focus for homeowners aiming to make their homes more attractive.</p>



<p>High-quality materials like granite or engineered quartz often feature prominently in listings and can be a selling point. They can also impact the perceived value of your home, potentially leading to a higher sale price.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How To Choose Your Kitchen Countertop</h2>



<p>It&#8217;s essential to navigate the myriad of materials, each with its distinct characteristics and suitability for various applications.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Material Selection</h3>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Natural Stones</h4>



<p><strong>Granite</strong>: Granite remains an excellent choice for outdoor kitchens and <a href="https://fineartinteriors.com/why-in-home-bars-are-making-a-comeback/">in-home bars</a>. Its resilience against the elements and the fact that it doesn&#8217;t warp like quartz—which is susceptible to deformation under UV exposure due to its resin content—make it a staple for outdoor design.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Marble</strong>: With its classic beauty and timeless elegance, a marble countertop is revered for its luxurious look. However, due to its high porosity, its practical application in high-traffic areas like kitchens and bathrooms is limited. Marble can etch and stain easily, making it a high-maintenance option that&#8217;s not ideal for clients who are not prepared for the upkeep.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Quartzite</strong>: Quartzite is the material of choice for most kitchen, bathroom, and fireplace projects due to its versatility and durability. With an array of options in terms of color and patterns, it offers designers the flexibility to match any aesthetic.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Onyx</strong>: Onyx is the showstopper reserved for features where you want to create a dramatic visual impact through backlighting. Traditionally limited in color options, with a prevalence of orange and yellow hues, the market now sees a wider array of colors as new onyx varieties are introduced.&nbsp;</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Engineered Surfaces</h4>



<p><strong>Quartz</strong>: As the trend shifts towards more seamless designs, man-made quartz is gaining momentum, favored for its clean lines and uncluttered appearance. It&#8217;s not only easy to work with but also offers significant health benefits due to its antibacterial and anti-microbial properties, making it a major selling point for health-conscious homeowners.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Petrified Wood</strong>: For a truly distinctive touch, petrified wood offers an element of ancient natural beauty. It&#8217;s especially gorgeous for powder room countertops, where its dramatic presence transforms a small space into a conversation piece.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Copper</strong>: <a href="https://food52.com/blog/17080-copper-kitchen-countertops-practical-or-magic">Copper countertops</a> offer a unique combination of functionality, beauty, and health benefits for the kitchen. They are particularly suited to homeowners who appreciate materials that age and develop character over time. While copper requires some care to maintain its appearance, its aesthetic appeal and antimicrobial properties make it a material worth considering for those looking to make a design statement in their kitchen.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Color Considerations</h3>



<p>The strategic use of color and pattern in kitchen countertops plays a pivotal role in shaping the mood and perception of space within the home.&nbsp;</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Using Color to Influence Mood</h4>



<p>Color psychology is a key factor in interior design, influencing how a space feels and the emotions of those within it. Warm<a href="https://www.hgtv.com/design/remodel/interior-remodel/the-psychology-of-color"> hues</a> such as reds, oranges, and yellows can evoke feelings of warmth and energy, making them ideal for areas where social interaction and food preparation occur, such as kitchens.</p>



<p>Conversely, <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/what-are-cool-colors-1973821">cool colors</a> like blues, greens, and purples create a calming and relaxing atmosphere. They are excellent for spaces where one wants to foster a sense of serenity and tranquility. For a kitchen, softer shades of these colors can balance the hustle and bustle of kitchen activity, making the space feel more peaceful and organized.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Kitchen Countertop Trends to Consider</h2>



<p>The kitchen countertop landscape is continuously evolving, with new materials, designs, and technologies emerging to meet the changing preferences and lifestyles of homeowners.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Emerging Materials and Innovative Designs</h3>



<p>Innovative materials like ultra-compact surfaces are gaining popularity for their durability and versatility. These surfaces are engineered to withstand high temperatures, scratches, and UV light, making them ideal for indoor and outdoor kitchens. High-grade Lucite, a form of premium acrylic, is making its way into the kitchen as a material for countertops, offering a sleek look and a range of functional benefits. Its use in kitchens marks a trend toward innovative materials that blend aesthetic appeal with practicality.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Color Trends: From Bold Statements to Classic Neutrals</h3>



<p>While classic neutrals like whites, grays, and beiges remain popular for their timeless appeal and versatility, there&#8217;s a growing trend toward incorporating bold colors. Deep blues, greens, and even matte black countertops create focal points and add depth to kitchen designs.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Texture and Pattern Trends: Veining, Flecking, and Gloss vs. Matte Finishes</h3>



<p>The demand for textured and patterned countertops is rising, with homeowners looking for unique surfaces that add character to their kitchens. Veining and flecking mimic the natural patterns found in marble and granite, offering the beauty of natural stone with the durability and maintenance ease of engineered materials.</p>



<p>Choosing between gloss and matte finishes depends on personal preference and the kitchen&#8217;s overall design theme. Glossy finishes enhance brightness and create a more spacious appearance by reflecting light, whereas matte finishes provide a subdued, modern aesthetic that better conceals fingerprints and smudges.<br><br>The Use of Water Jetting to Create Various Textures</p>



<p>Water jet cutting is a flexible and accurate technology that significantly improves the customization and craftsmanship of kitchen countertops. This cutting-edge technique utilizes a high-pressure stream of water to cut through materials with exceptional accuracy. Here’s a breakdown of the types of textures that can be achieved using this technology:</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Smooth Surfaces</h4>



<p>Water jet cutting is renowned for its ability to create exceptionally smooth cuts and edges. This is beneficial for materials like marble, granite, and other stones used in kitchen countertops, where a smooth finish is both appealing and practical.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Etched and Matte Finishes</h4>



<p>Water jet cutting can be adjusted to etch surfaces, providing a matte finish that can be used for anti-slip properties or for decorative purposes. This technique involves controlling the pressure of the water jet to lightly score the surface without cutting through the material, allowing for the creation of detailed patterns and designs.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Textured Patterns</h4>



<p>Water jet cutters can create a variety of textured patterns by varying the speed and pressure of the jet and using different abrasives. These include grooved, ribbed, or wavy textures that can add depth and interest to surfaces.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Honed Finishes</h4>



<p>A honed finish is achieved when the stone&#8217;s surface is ground to a smooth, flat, consistent surface. Unlike polished finishes, which are glossy and highly reflective, honed finishes offer a matte appearance with little to no shine. The process of honing tones down the stone&#8217;s color and provides a more natural look. Water jet cutting enables the precise cutting of stone to the required size and shape before the honing process begins.&nbsp;</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Leathered Finishes</h4>



<p>Leathered finishes involve a more complex process that includes texturing the stone to achieve a soft, rippled appearance similar to that of leather. The texture not only adds visual interest but also hides fingerprints and smudges, making it highly suitable for high-traffic areas. Water jet cutting complements this finish by first shaping the stone precisely as required. Subsequently, specialized tools are used to texture the surface, achieving the leathered effect.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>How Water Jetting Can Shape Kitchen Countertops</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Material Versatility</li>
</ul>



<p>Water jet cutting is effective on a wide range of materials used in kitchen countertops, including granite, marble, quartz, and even metals like stainless steel or copper. This flexibility lets designers and homeowners choose from a wide range of materials without concern for the constraints of conventional cutting techniques.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Complex Designs and Customization</li>
</ul>



<p>Water jet cutting enables the crafting of detailed and sophisticated designs with remarkable accuracy. This technique is especially useful for customizing kitchen countertops with distinctive patterns, curves, and inlays that conventional cutting tools would struggle or fail to achieve.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Smooth and Precise Cuts</li>
</ul>



<p>The technology ensures smooth, clean cuts that minimize the risk of chipping or cracking the material, which is often a concern with harder surfaces like granite. The precision of water jet cutting also means that the fit between different sections of the countertop is seamless, contributing to a polished and professional finish.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Efficiency and Safety</li>
</ul>



<p>Water jet cutting does not generate heat, making it a safer option that avoids altering the intrinsic properties of the materials used. This cold-cutting method ensures that the structural integrity of the countertop materials remains intact, preserving both their beauty and durability.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Making the Decision</h2>



<p>Deciding on the perfect kitchen countertop involves navigating the fine line between embracing current trends and choosing a timeless design.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The Balance Between Trendy and Timeless</h3>



<p>Trends can offer fresh and exciting ideas that bring your kitchen into the contemporary moment. They reflect current innovations in materials, colors, and technology, providing opportunities to make a bold statement in your home.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On the other hand, timeless designs offer longevity in both style and functionality. Materials like granite, marble, and natural quartzite have enduring appeal, with their natural beauty and durability standing the test of time.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Consultation with Design Professionals</h3>



<p>Design professionals bring a wealth of knowledge and experience. They can provide insights into the longevity of materials, the practicality of certain designs in real-world use, and how different choices might affect your home&#8217;s value. They&#8217;re also up-to-date on the latest innovations and can suggest options you might not have considered.</p>



<p>A professional can help you navigate many options by considering your lifestyle, budget, and design preferences. They&#8217;ll discuss the pros and cons of different materials, suggest combinations that match your aesthetic, and help you visualize the final look.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Conclusion</h2>



<p>Selecting the perfect countertop is not merely about choosing a surface for preparing your meals; it&#8217;s about making a decision that influences the daily rhythms of your home life, enhances the aesthetic appeal of your living space, and reflects your style.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In conclusion, choosing a kitchen countertop has far-reaching implications for your home and lifestyle. By thoughtfully evaluating your choices and selecting one that fits your requirements, style, and budget, you can ensure that your kitchen continues to be a cherished focal point of your home for many years.</p>

<p></p>



<p>In the ever-evolving world of interior design, the trend of mixing metals has emerged as a versatile way to add depth, contrast, and a personalized touch to any space. This approach breaks away from traditional design rules that advocate for uniformity in metal finishes, offering possibilities for creating harmonious environments.</p>



<p>This guide answers this question and provides useful tips and strategies for successfully integrating mixed metals into home decor.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Can You Mix Metals in Your Home?</h2>



<p>Intentionally mixing metals within a space is a trend and a design strategy that significantly enhances an interior&#8217;s elegance and sophistication. The traditional approach of adhering to a single metal finish throughout a room often leads to visual monotony, rendering the space flat and one-dimensional. This monochromatic style once considered the hallmark of cohesive design, can limit a room&#8217;s aesthetic potential.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In contrast, incorporating up to three different metal finishes introduces a layer of complexity and visual intrigue that can transform an ordinary space into a captivating and dynamic environment. The strategic combination of various metal finishes—such as the warmth of brass, the coolness of chrome, and the earthiness of copper—creates a tapestry of textures and hues that add depth and character to any interior.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This practice allows for a nuanced design narrative that can evoke different moods and styles, from the understated elegance of a minimalist space to the opulent charm of a more traditional setting.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Mixing Metals in the Kitchen</h3>



<p>Delving deeper into the art of mixing metals in the kitchen reveals a subtle approach that can enhance this central space&#8217;s aesthetic appeal and functionality. Understanding the <a href="https://www.homesandgardens.com/interior-design/jordan-samson-mixing-metals-tips">metal&#8217;s color</a> temperature, sheen, placement, and purpose is crucial to achieving a harmonious and visually pleasing environment.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Warm vs. Cool Tones</h4>



<p>The distinction between warm and cool tones forms the foundation for effectively mixing metals. Warm metals, such as brass, gold, copper, and oil-rubbed bronze, emit a cozy, inviting glow that can add richness to the kitchen. These metals often pair beautifully with rich wood tones, natural stone, or other elements emphasizing warmth and comfort.</p>



<p>Cool metals, including chrome, polished nickel, and brushed nickel, offer a sleek and modern vibe. They reflect light and contribute to a sense of spaciousness and cleanliness. These metals complement materials like marble, stainless steel, and glass, making them the go-to choices for contemporary or minimalist kitchens.</p>



<p>Black metal, straddling the line between cool-toned and neutral, is an excellent mediator in a mixed-metal palette. Its versatility complements warm and cool metals, acting as a grounding force that ties different elements together without overpowering the design.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Mixing Metals in the Kitchen: The Do&#8217;s</h4>



<p><strong>Combine Warm and Cool Tones</strong>: <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/4-rules-designers-say-you-should-follow-or-ignore-when-mixing-metals-in-a-room-5199031">Introducing warm and cool metals</a> into the kitchen creates a dynamic and balanced aesthetic. For example, pairing brushed nickel (cool) with copper accents (warm) can produce a modern and inviting kitchen.<br><br><strong>Use Black as a Balancing Element</strong>: Incorporating black fixtures or hardware can help unify the mix. They provide a visual anchor that enhances the overall design without detracting from the interplay of different metals.</p>



<p><strong>Consider the Sheen</strong>: Aligning the sheen across different metals—polished, brushed, or matte—can unify the elements, making the combination appear intentional and cohesive. Polished finishes are particularly effective at capturing light and creating a sense of luxury.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="983" height="1024" src="https://fineartinteriors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Cafe-Appliances-Matte-Black-Full-Size-Refrigerator-with-Brushed-Brass-Hardware-983x1024.jpeg" alt="Cafe Appliances Full-Size Refrigerator with Brushed Brass Hardware Fine Arts Interiors Tuscon AZ" class="wp-image-9202" srcset="https://fineartinteriors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Cafe-Appliances-Matte-Black-Full-Size-Refrigerator-with-Brushed-Brass-Hardware-983x1024.jpeg 983w, https://fineartinteriors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Cafe-Appliances-Matte-Black-Full-Size-Refrigerator-with-Brushed-Brass-Hardware-288x300.jpeg 288w, https://fineartinteriors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Cafe-Appliances-Matte-Black-Full-Size-Refrigerator-with-Brushed-Brass-Hardware-768x800.jpeg 768w, https://fineartinteriors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Cafe-Appliances-Matte-Black-Full-Size-Refrigerator-with-Brushed-Brass-Hardware-1475x1536.jpeg 1475w, https://fineartinteriors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Cafe-Appliances-Matte-Black-Full-Size-Refrigerator-with-Brushed-Brass-Hardware-1966x2048.jpeg 1966w" sizes="(max-width: 983px) 100vw, 983px" /></figure>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Mixing Metals in the Kitchen: The Don&#8217;ts</h4>



<p><strong>Avoid Mixing Similar Metals in Close Proximity</strong>: Mixing metals within the same family (e.g., nickel and chrome) can sometimes have a discordant look, especially if they are close together. This is because their similarities might clash rather than complement each other.</p>



<p><strong>Don&#8217;t Overlook the Impact of Finish</strong>: While mixing different <a href="https://www.bhg.com/decorating/lessons/expert-advice/how-to-mix-metals/">finishes</a> is possible, doing so without a clear strategy can lead to a disjointed appearance. Consistency in sheen helps in creating a more deliberate and harmonious look.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Tips for Achieving Balance and Cohesion</h2>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Choose a Dominant Metal</h4>



<p>The dominant metal is the anchor for the kitchen&#8217;s overall design, setting the tone and direction for subsequent choices. This primary finish is typically applied to larger elements within the space, which can include:</p>



<p><strong>Pendant Lights</strong>: These fixtures are significant lighting sources and focal points of aesthetic interest. Choosing a dominant metal for pendant lighting fixtures can significantly influence the room&#8217;s ambiance.</p>



<p><strong>Stainless Steel Appliances</strong>: Given their size and centrality to kitchen function, stainless steel appliances or another chosen dominant metal finish can seamlessly integrate functionality with style.</p>



<p><strong>Plumbing Fixtures</strong>: Faucets and sinks in the dominant metal finish contribute to the cohesive look, drawing together the design elements within the space. Focusing on these larger elements, the dominant metal establishes a visual baseline, creating a sense of harmony and unity in the kitchen.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Choose a Color Palette</h4>



<p>Incorporating metal finishes into your kitchen decor with an eye toward complementing the overall <a href="https://storables.com/interior-design/how-to-mix-metals-expert-tips-for-combining-finishes-perfectly/">color palette</a> of your home is a refined strategy that ensures design continuity and harmony.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Pairing Metals with Color Palettes</strong></p>



<p><strong>Warm Metals&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>With its inherent warmth and richness, gold pairs beautifully with cream colors with warm undertones. This combination evokes a sense of luxury and warmth, making the kitchen feel welcoming and opulent.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, copper offers an earthy quality that can enhance cream colors, adding a layer of depth and interest. Its vibrant, reflective properties can also give the space lively energy.</p>



<p>When integrating warm metals like gold and copper, it&#8217;s beneficial to lean into color palettes that complement these tones. Colors with warm undertones, such as creams, beiges, and soft yellows, can create a cohesive and inviting environment that highlights the beauty of the metals.</p>



<p><strong>Cool Metals</strong></p>



<p>Stainless steel&#8217;s sleek, modern appeal is effortlessly complemented by cool tones like light blue and bright white. This combination creates a crisp, clean look that feels contemporary and spacious.</p>



<p>Conversely, whether polished or brushed, nickel harmoniously complements cool-toned color schemes, enhancing the sense of freshness and tranquility in the kitchen. For kitchens featuring cool metals, selecting a color palette with cool undertones—such as blues, greens, and grays—can establish a serene and cohesive aesthetic. These color schemes support the metal finishes, reinforcing a unified and timeless design.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Mixed Metal Bathroom Designs</h3>



<p>Mixing metals in the bathroom is an excellent way to infuse the space with visual interest and depth, creating a modern and classic look. This approach to interior design enhances the bathroom&#8217;s aesthetic appeal and offers the flexibility to evolve with changing tastes and trends over time.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Timeless Finishes for Permanent Fixtures</h4>



<p>Selecting timeless finishes for permanent fixtures is a strategic choice that ensures the core elements of your bathroom remain stylish and functional for years to come. Finishes like chrome, polished nickel, and brass have stood the test of time, offering durability and enduring appeal.</p>



<p><strong>Chrome</strong>: Known for its high shine and reflective quality, chrome is a versatile finish that complements virtually any design style, from ultra-modern to traditionally classic. It&#8217;s particularly effective in enhancing a bathroom&#8217;s brightness and spaciousness.</p>



<p><strong>Polished Nickel</strong>: Offering a warmer tone than chrome, polished nickel provides a subtle hint of warmth while maintaining a sleek and sophisticated appearance. It works beautifully in both contemporary and vintage-inspired bathroom designs.<br><br><strong>Brass</strong>: Brass fixtures add a touch of warmth and luxury, contributing to a rich, inviting atmosphere. For an elegant and unique look, choose a timeless option like brushed brass or live-finish brass over polished brass, which can look dated.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Incorporating Secondary Metal Finishes</h4>



<p>Using secondary metal finishes on elements like mirrors, drawers, door pulls, towel bars, and other accessories allows for creative expression and personalization within the space. Since items like cabinet hardware and mirrors are relatively easy to update, they offer an opportunity to refresh the bathroom&#8217;s look without a complete overhaul.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Recommended Combinations</h4>



<p><strong>Chrome and Brass/Gold</strong>: This classic pairing unites chrome’s crisp, clean appeal with the warm, luxurious touch of brass or gold, creating a balanced and sophisticated look that suits various bathroom styles.<br><br><strong>Brushed Nickel or Polished Nickel and Brass</strong>: Whether brushed for a softer look or polished for more sparkle, nickel finishes blend beautifully with brass accents. This combination combines nickel&#8217;s understated elegance with brass&#8217;s warmth and richness.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Examples of Mixing Metals</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Black and Gold</h3>



<p>The contrast of black and gold decor is synonymous with luxury and timeless elegance. This combination can transform living rooms and bedrooms into spaces that exude opulence and warmth. Here are some ways to incorporate black and gold decor into these spaces, alongside tips for achieving a balanced and inviting aesthetic.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Living Rooms</h4>



<p>Integrating a palette of black and gold can create luxurious spaces within your home. This dynamic duo brings a level of elegance and warmth to any room, making it possible to craft spaces that feel both opulent and inviting.</p>



<p>One effective way to introduce this luxurious combination is to create a feature wall. Imagine a black feature wall serving as a dramatic backdrop in your living room or bedroom. This bold design choice adds depth to the space and is an ideal canvas to highlight the richness of gold accents.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Furniture selection is another crucial aspect of incorporating black and gold into your decor. Opting for black sofas or chairs adorned with gold detailing, such as elegant gold legs or intricate inlay work, can seamlessly integrate both hues into your living space. These pieces naturally draw the eye and serve as focal points that exude a sense of luxury and sophistication.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Bedrooms</h4>



<p>In bedrooms, the interplay between black and gold can transform a simple sleeping area into a haven of luxury and tranquility. When thoughtfully applied, this color combination can create a lavish and comforting atmosphere, inviting rest in an elegant setting.</p>



<p>Starting with any bedroom&#8217;s centerpiece, the bed offers a prime opportunity to showcase this palette. A black bed frame provides a bold foundation that can be contrasted with gold furniture hardware like bracket-style legs and drawer pulls. Pair gold hanging pendant lights above the nightstands or a luxurious chandelier with gold accents. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Wall decor plays a significant role in defining the room&#8217;s character, and incorporating gold accents here can elevate the space to new heights of elegance. A bold, gold-framed piece of artwork can act as a stunning focal point in a predominantly black bedroom. In this context, wallpapers, particularly those designed by Phillip Jefferies, emerge as an essential element in crafting an opulent and cohesive aesthetic. Their collection showcases a sophisticated blend of metal finishes, seamlessly mixing silver with gold to create a backdrop that radiates luxury. Moreover, Phillip Jefferies&#8217; designs often incorporate a striking contrast of <a href="https://www.phillipjeffries.com/shop/CARD-AG-ADORN/9293">black with gold accents</a>, offering a dynamic and modern approach to bedroom decor.  </p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Brass Decor</h4>



<p>Brass decor, with its distinct warmth and timeless appeal, has long been cherished in interior design for its ability to warm any space. This malleable metal, known for its golden hue, adds a touch of richness that can elevate a room&#8217;s overall aesthetic. When thoughtfully integrated with other metals and decor elements, brass can create an inviting and visually alluring blend.</p>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading">The Warmth of Brass and Complementing Metals</h5>



<p>Brass, inherently warm due to its yellow and golden tones, pairs beautifully with a wide range of other materials and metals. Its rich, polished finish can contrast strikingly against cooler metals, such as brushed nickel or chrome, creating a balanced and dynamic interplay between warm and cool tones. This contrast adds depth to the decor and allows each element to stand out in its own right.</p>



<p>Incorporating brass with darker metals, like wrought iron or oil-rubbed bronze, can produce a harmonious effect. Brass&#8217;s brightness can lighten and enrich spaces dominated by darker tones, offering a visually appealing contrast that draws the eye. </p>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading">Suggested Rooms and Items for Brass Accents</h5>



<p></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Living Rooms</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Brass chandeliers or wall sconces can add a focal point of warmth and elegance. Brass frames, candleholders, and vases can be strategically placed throughout the space to add subtle gleams of warmth.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Kitchens</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Mixing metals on oven ranges has become very popular, and top brands like GE Monogram, GE Cafe, and Miele are including a few gold accents like knobs and gas rings on a few of their <a href="https://www.cafeappliances.com/collections/customizable-professional/">current product offerings</a>.<br><br>Cabinet knobs, drawer pulls, and <a href="https://hoodsly.com/media/kitchen365gallery/image/Curved-Brass-Strapping-4836-min-scaled.jpeg">hood trim</a> in brass can transform the look of your kitchen, offering a touch of sophistication. A brass kitchen faucet or sink can serve as a stunning centerpiece, especially against a backdrop of marble or dark countertops. </p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Bathrooms</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Brass faucets, showerheads, and towel racks introduce a luxurious element into the bathroom. A brass-framed mirror can add elegance and make the space appear larger and brighter.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Bedrooms</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>A brass bed frame or headboard can instantly elevate the room’s aesthetic and provide a focal point. Bedside lamps with brass bases can add a touch of warmth and complement both modern and traditional decor.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Mixing Gold and Silver</h4>



<p>Mixing gold and silver in interior design represents a bold departure from traditional decor rules that once dictated metals should match within a space. This approach embraces the beauty and diversity of combining these two precious metals, offering a contrast that can enhance any room&#8217;s visual appeal.</p>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading">Breaking the Old Rule: Harmonizing Gold and Silver</h5>



<p></p>



<p>Integrating gold and silver into a cohesive design scheme challenges the outdated notion that these metals cannot coexist in the same space. Gold, with its warm, lustrous glow, and silver, known for its cool, reflective elegance, can indeed complement each other beautifully when paired thoughtfully.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The key to successfully mixing these metals is embracing their differences and using them to create a balanced, harmonious aesthetic. This approach adds depth and interest to your decor and reflects a sophisticated and confident style.</p>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading">Strategies for Balancing These Metals in Decor</h5>



<p></p>



<p>Starting with a neutral color palette for walls and major furniture pieces allows gold and silver accents to stand out without competing with each other. This backdrop highlights each metal&#8217;s unique qualities, ensuring they enhance rather than overpower the space.<br><br>While both metals will share the spotlight, designating one as the dominant metal can help achieve balance in the room. This doesn’t mean the chosen metal should overwhelm the space but rather serve as the primary accent around which the other metal is introduced. For instance, gold could be the dominant metal with larger furniture pieces or fixtures, complemented by silver decorative accents. The high-end decor company Michael Aram offers<a href="https://michaelaram.com/products/vintage-bloom-vase?variant=42308507926721"> exquisite mixed metal pieces</a> inspired by nature that would elevate any room.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What Should Be Avoided When Mixing Metals</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Overuse of Different Metals</h3>



<p>Introducing too many different metal types into a single space can create visual chaos rather than cohesion. The variety may lead to a disjointed appearance, where the room feels cluttered and unsettled. To avoid this, limit the mix to two or three metal types. This restraint ensures that each metal can be appreciated for contributing to the overall design without overwhelming the space.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Neglecting a Focal Point</h3>



<p>Without a clear focal point or dominant metal, a space can lack direction and intention, making the design feel accidental rather than curated. Ensure that one metal is the primary focus around which other metals are introduced as complementary accents. This hierarchy helps to maintain order and visual interest within the design.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Selecting the Right Metal Mix</h4>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading">Understanding the Role of Color Temperature in Metal Selection</h5>



<p></p>



<p>Metals can be categorized by their color temperature, and understanding the impact of these temperatures on a room&#8217;s ambiance is key. Selecting metals complementing the room&#8217;s overall color scheme and desired mood ensures a harmonious blend. For instance, warm metals pair beautifully with warm-colored walls, whereas cool metals complement rooms with cooler hues.</p>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading">The Importance of Distribution and Proportion in Mixed Metal Decor</h5>



<p></p>



<p>Even distribution and thoughtful proportion play crucial roles in balancing mixed metal decor. It&#8217;s crucial to spread different metals throughout the space rather than clustering them in one area. This distribution creates a cohesive look that seamlessly integrates the various metals into the overall design.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Conclusion</h2>



<p>Mixed metal decor&#8217;s beauty lies in its aesthetic appeal and ability to transform spaces into rich and layered environments. It symbolizes modern design thinking, where the rules are seen as guidelines rather than strict directives, and personal taste and creativity are paramount. As we continue to explore the possibilities within interior design, mixed metals remain a compelling and beautiful testament to the enduring power of thoughtful and intentional design. So embrace the versatility and charm of mixed metals in your home, and watch as your space comes alive with style and character.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How Mirrors Can Alter the Perception of a Space</h2>



<p>Mirrors offer multiple ways to enhance the perception of a space, creating visual illusions and transforming the ambiance of a room. Not only do they have the ability to alter the perception of a space in various ways, but they also provide a <a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/everyone-is-buying-mirrors-right-now-but-why">cost-effective alternative</a> to traditional room decor such as art. While artwork can be expensive and limited in size and style, mirrors offer a wider range of options at a fraction of the cost.&nbsp;<br><br>Here are six ways mirrors can alter the perception of a space:<br><br><strong>Enhanced Depth and Space</strong>: Have you ever walked into a small apartment and felt like the space suddenly opened up? Mirrors possess the magical ability to make rooms seem much larger than they actually are.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Increased Light and Brightness</strong>: Imagine entering a dimly lit room and suddenly feeling enveloped in a warm and inviting glow. Mirrors act as natural light boosters by bouncing and distributing light throughout a space. A great example is placing a mirror across from a window, allowing it to reflect the natural light streaming in. This brightens the room and reduces the need for additional lighting fixtures.<br><br><strong>Visual Interest and Focal Point</strong>: Have you ever been captivated by a beautifully crafted mirror that instantly drew your focus? Mirrors can serve as compelling centerpieces in a room, adding depth and visual interest to any space. A unique, ornate mirror placed above a fireplace can become the focal point of a living room, instantly elevating its style and charm.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Reflection of Views</strong>: Imagine sitting in your living room and enjoying the breathtaking view of your garden from multiple angles. To strategically hang a mirror across from a picturesque window or a lush garden can create a stunning visual effect, further enhancing the beauty of your living space.<br><br><strong>Room Balance and Symmetry</strong>: Mirrors contribute to this symmetrical effect by creating a sense of equilibrium. For example, by placing mirrors on either side of a mantel, you can achieve a balanced composition that complements other decor elements, such as artwork or furniture, creating a cohesive and visually appealing space.<br><br><strong>Illusion of Height</strong>: Picture stepping into a room with low ceilings and suddenly feeling as if the ceiling has been raised. One effective way to achieve this is by strategically positioning tall mirrors on the walls, preferably across from windows or other natural light sources.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How to hang a mirror</h2>



<p><strong>1. Gather Necessary Tools and Materials</strong><br><br>Before you begin, gather what you&#8217;ll need, such as a level, measuring tape, wall anchors (such as toggle bolts or molly bolts for heavier mirrors), screws, a screwdriver, and a stud finder (if needed).<br><br><strong>2. Find the Right Spot on the Wall</strong></p>



<p>Choose the location carefully. Consider the room&#8217;s design and the mirror&#8217;s functional purpose, such as aiding in grooming, reflecting light, or creating a focal point.<br><br><strong>3. Mark the Wall and Measure for Accuracy</strong></p>



<p>Measure the mirror&#8217;s dimensions and mark the wall with the desired placement. If you&#8217;re hanging a series of mirrors, use painter&#8217;s tape to visualize their arrangement on the wall before marking.<br><br><strong>4. Determine the Weight and Mounting Method</strong></p>



<p>Determine the weight of the mirror to ensure you use appropriate mounting hardware. To determine the weight of the mirror, you can try two methods. Firstly, if you can lift the mirror, you can weigh yourself without the mirror and then weigh yourself again while holding the mirror. The difference between the two weights will give you the approximate weight of the mirror. Alternatively, you can contact the supplier from whom you purchased the mirror and ask them directly for the weight.<br><br>For heavier mirrors, it&#8217;s advisable to mount them on wall studs for added stability. A wall stud is a vertical structural support behind a wall. To find them, visually inspect for nails or screws, or use a stud finder, a handheld device that detects density changes. Mark the stud locations and adjust mirror placement for added stability.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>5. Mount the Mirror</strong><br><br>Attach the mounting hardware to the back of the mirror, following the manufacturer&#8217;s instructions. For mirrors with D-ring hangers or wire, measure the distance from the top edge of the mirror to the mounting hardware and mark the wall where the screws or hooks will go. Use a level to ensure the hardware is aligned correctly.</p>



<p><strong>6. Checking for Stability and Adjusting If Necessary</strong><br><br>Once you hang the mirror, double-check its stability and alignment. Stand back and assess whether it&#8217;s straight and level. If adjustments are needed, carefully loosen the screws or hooks and make the necessary changes. Use the level again to ensure the mirror is straight before tightening the screws or hooks.</p>

<p>Curtains play a crucial role in both the aesthetic and functional aspects of home decor. They manage privacy, control light, and introduce an element of style and sophistication to any room.</p>



<p>Within the interior design community, there&#8217;s a distinction between &#8220;curtains&#8221; and &#8220;drapes.&#8221; Like the distinction between &#8220;couch&#8221; and &#8220;sofa,&#8221; designers often use the term &#8220;drapes&#8221; to refer to a particular category of custom-made window treatments.</p>



<p>When striving for a classic and well-tailored look, the choice of curtains is paramount. You can choose curtains that delicately graze the floor or exhibit a slight break, maintaining a tidy and refined appearance. This meticulous touch contributes to a polished ambiance that resonates throughout the room.</p>



<p>On the other hand, if your vision leans more towards an informal and laid-back atmosphere, curtains can gracefully puddle onto the floor. This involves allowing an extra 2 to 4 inches of length, creating a gentle pooling effect. This approach imparts a relaxed charm in line with a more casual aesthetic.</p>



<p>In this article, we will discuss curtain measurements, how to measure windows for curtains and curtain rods, and the importance of measuring curtains accurately.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="754" src="https://fineartinteriors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Curtains-Blog-Post-1-Kimberly-Fine-Arts-Interiors-1024x754.jpg" alt="Long curtains drapes in living room with neutral colored couches overlooking the pool in Tuscon, Arizona" class="wp-image-9137" srcset="https://fineartinteriors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Curtains-Blog-Post-1-Kimberly-Fine-Arts-Interiors-1024x754.jpg 1024w, https://fineartinteriors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Curtains-Blog-Post-1-Kimberly-Fine-Arts-Interiors-300x221.jpg 300w, https://fineartinteriors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Curtains-Blog-Post-1-Kimberly-Fine-Arts-Interiors-768x565.jpg 768w, https://fineartinteriors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Curtains-Blog-Post-1-Kimberly-Fine-Arts-Interiors-1536x1130.jpg 1536w, https://fineartinteriors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Curtains-Blog-Post-1-Kimberly-Fine-Arts-Interiors-2048x1507.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Standard Curtain Lengths</h2>



<p>When deciding your curtain lengths, you can select from various options based on your room&#8217;s aesthetics, functionality, and personal preferences. The most common curtain lengths include floor-length, sill-length, and below-sill-length curtains.</p>



<p>Floor-length curtains are often chosen for formal spaces like living rooms or dining rooms, as they create an elegant and luxurious ambiance by extending all the way to the floor. Sill-length curtains have been used in the past in kitchens or casual settings, covering the window while allowing easy access to the sill. Below-sill-length curtains are sometimes found in bedrooms or offices, offering a balance between coverage and maintaining a visually open space. However, a more modern option would be to have a woven or Roman shade on the windows if the treatment needs to stop at the sill or just below. The choice of curtain length depends on factors such as your room&#8217;s purpose, decor style, and the desired amount of light and privacy.</p>



<p>Consider the size of your window when determining the ideal curtain width. If you have larger windows, opting for custom-length curtains might be necessary to ensure a proper fit.</p>



<p>The placement of the rod primarily determines the length of the drapes. Generally, the rod should be positioned as high as possible within reason. When windows are set closer to the ground, there can often be a significant gap between the ceiling and the top of the window.</p>



<p>For installations more than 24 inches above the window, consider layering your window treatment with a woven shade or Roman shade. This hides the elevated placement of the drapes, minimizing the exposed wall area above the window. Alternatively, if you opt not to layer, maintaining a distance of around 10 inches above the window is recommended. Higher drape placement creates a more dramatic effect, lifting the room&#8217;s visual appeal.</p>



<p>Additionally, if you want the drapes to kiss the floor, a ¼ inch break is suitable (akin to a slight break in men’s pants). Opting for a longer break of 1-2 inches imparts a more relaxed look. Besides length, the choice of fabric affects how curtains hang. Heavier fabrics pair well with formal, floor-length curtains, while lighter fabrics create an airy feel.</p>



<p>Considering light requirements, sheer fabrics offer gentle illumination, while denser materials give you better light control and privacy.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Drapes vs. Curtains: Understanding the Differences</h2>



<p>In interior design, drapes and curtains each have <a href="https://www.hunker.com/13768314/curtains-vs-drapes">distinct characteristics</a> and uses. Crafted from heavier fabrics, drapes offer enhanced insulation and light control, often lining formal spaces like dining rooms and grand entryways. On the other hand, curtains are lighter and more decorative, introducing style while preserving natural light. Found in bedrooms, kitchens, and casual living areas, they evoke a more relaxed atmosphere.<br><br>Curtains are often pre-made, and there are some types of curtains that require additional hardware, such as loops or ring clips, to attach to the rods. In contrast, drapes tend to be custom-made and use fasteners, such as snap fasteners, rings, or ball-bearing carriers in the pleats that connect to the specific kind of drapery rod.<br><br>Over the last decade, the drapery industry has undergone a notable transformation. Drapes have adopted a simpler and more streamlined aesthetic. Rod sizes have reduced from the previous 3” diameter rods. Finials have shifted towards a more understated and less elaborate style. The current trends reject excess fabric like puddling, tiebacks with billowing sleeves, swags, and jabots, with even valances and cornices from five years ago being phased out. </p>



<p>If you’re seeking a truly customized and polished look, it has become more common to purchase custom drapes through a professional designer.</p>

<p>Consider the following factors when dealing with drapery:</p>



<p><strong>Window Proximity:</strong> Take into account the spacing between windows, as this influences how drapes will visually connect or separate them.</p>



<p><strong>Ceiling Distance:</strong> The distance from the ceiling matters, impacting the drape&#8217;s length and how it visually interacts with the room&#8217;s height.</p>



<p><strong>Molding Presence:</strong> Assess whether windows feature molding around them, as this detail affects how drapes hang and interact with the overall window structure.</p>



<p><strong>Sill Width:</strong> Determine if window sills are wide enough to allow for inside mounts of drapery or if outside mounts are more suitable.</p>



<p><strong>Room Decor:</strong> Consider the existing decor in the room; vibrant fabrics might be chosen for a dramatic effect, while more subdued fabrics can maintain a tone-on-tone ambiance.</p>



<p><strong>Layering Options:</strong> Layering drapes with roller or woven shades offers versatility; you can decide whether to add layers for additional depth or keep it simple.</p>



<p><strong>Interior Style</strong>: Depending on whether the room follows a contemporary, transitional, or traditional design, your drapery selection should align with the overall aesthetic.</p>



<p><strong>Ceiling Height and Window Layout</strong>: Account for factors like ceiling height and window layout, including transom windows above doors or high-set windows, which can influence drape placement.</p>



<p><strong>Drapery with Doors:</strong> When integrating drapery with doors, consider privacy needs. Decide whether to use woven shades on each door and drapery panels between the doors for the desired effect.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How to Measure Windows for Curtains</h2>



<p>To kick off the process of <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/how-to-measure-a-window-for-curtains-6747821">measuring windows for curtains</a>, gather a few essential tools: a steel tape measure, a stepladder or stool (based on window height), and a notepad with a pen to record measurements.</p>



<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Measure your window frame&#8217;s width to determine the curtain rod or track size. Take measurements at the top, middle, and bottom, noting the smallest figure.</p>



<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Measure window height to decide curtain length. Measure at multiple points, noting the smallest measurement, from frame top to floor or the desired length. If there&#8217;s a windowsill or recess, account for it. For bays or deep sills, measure individual sections for rod/track sizing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If your windows are arched or curved, measure their widest width and the arch&#8217;s highest point to the bottom. These measurements guide special curtain rods or tracks.</p>



<p>When calculating curtain measurements, factor in obstacles like door handles and light switches, noting distance from the frame top. Installing curtains might be tricky due to frame irregularities or height/width variations; precise measurements and awareness of obstacles streamline the process.</p>



<p>Installing curtains can be tricky. Here are some key tips for dealing with the trickiest aspects.</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Fabric Width:</strong> Choose two or three fabric widths based on window size for fullness. Avoid using just one width.</li>



<li><strong>Hem Strategy:</strong> Go for wide hems on the edges and bottom of the curtains to hide the lining and give a cleaner appearance.</li>



<li><strong>Natural Pleats:</strong> Avoid pre-ironed pleats for a natural look.</li>



<li><strong>Lining and Interlining:</strong> Use lining and interlining, preferably blackout, for weight, draping, and light control.</li>



<li><strong>Top Measurement:</strong> Measure curtains from the top for a more elegant appearance.</li>



<li><strong>Shades Integration:</strong> If using shades with curtains, opt for an outside mount and position woven, Roman, or roller shades just below the curtain rod for a neat and streamlined look.</li>



<li><strong>Rod Selection:</strong> You don&#8217;t need expensive rods; thinner ones are often sufficient. If you dislike finials, choose a rod that attaches directly to the wall.</li>



<li><strong>Length:</strong> Avoid short curtains; opt for a ½” break for a natural fall.</li>
</ol>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How to Measure for Curtain Rods</h2>



<p>Not only do curtain rods play a functional role in supporting and holding up your curtains, but they also contribute to the overall aesthetic of your space.</p>



<p>Begin by measuring the width of your window to determine the curtain rod length you need. Ensure that you measure from one side to the other at the top, middle, and bottom of the frame.&nbsp;</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Determine the Curtain Type and Hanging Style</h4>



<p>Before measuring your windows for curtain rods, it&#8217;s essential to know that different curtain types require different rod styles and hanging methods. For example, pencil pleats or pleated curtains typically require curtain tracks or rods with hooks, while eyelet curtains need a rod that can easily slide through the eyelets.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">How to Choose the Right Curtain Rod Material and Style</h4>



<p>Choosing the right curtain rod material and style significantly impacts your curtains and room ambiance. Metal rods, like stainless steel or brass, provide versatility and durability for various curtain fabrics. Wooden rods add a warm, natural feel with different wood types and decorative finishes. Ornate decorative rods enhance elegance with intricate finials and brackets, while motorized rods offer effortless adjustments.</p>



<p>For the best match, consider your curtain weight – heavier drapes require sturdy options like thick metal or wood, while lighter curtains work well with thinner metal or lucite rods. This strategic pairing ensures both functional support and a cohesive design.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Standard Curtain Width</h2>



<p>Standard curtain widths, available in 10-inch increments like 40, 50, and 60 inches, cater to common window sizes, though specifics may vary by manufacturer. For an ideal fit, factor in your window size and consider custom-made curtains for larger windows. Custom-made will allow for different fullness of the fabric.&nbsp; Premade curtains may not give you the desired fullness and cause more of a stack back in the window, obstructing the view.</p>



<p>The choice between single and double curtain panels affects the appearance and functionality; Single panels are typically less wide and are suitable for narrow windows. Double curtain panels, on the other hand, provide a fuller and more luxurious appearance.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>To determine the right curtain width for your window, measure the window frame, then align it with your desired fullness, which is usually 2-2.5 times the window width. A wider rod would be needed to accommodate more fabric, more folds, and less stacked back into the window when the drapes are open all the way.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Budget</h4>



<p>Curtain prices can vary depending on fabric, brand, and customizations. Setting a budget is crucial, ensuring a balance between quality and style. Some cost-effective yet stylish strategies include choosing between ready-made and custom-made curtains based on window specifications, scouting seasonal sales and clearance events, and exploring online platforms for diverse options and competitive prices.&nbsp;You can even consider <a href="https://www.countryliving.com/diy-crafts/diy-curtains/">DIY alternatives</a>, which offer affordability and an opportunity to infuse a personal touch into your space.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Conclusion</h2>



<p>Accurate curtain measurements are essential for achieving the perfect window treatment. Factors such as window frame size, curtain rods, and window treatments will guide your decisions. Considering elements like fabric, color, pattern, style, and functionality ensures a well-informed choice that aligns with your home&#8217;s design.</p>



<p>While ready-made curtains offer convenience with standard sizes, custom-made options cater to unique window dimensions. To find curtains within your budget, keep an eye out for sales, clearance events, and online shopping platforms that provide quality and style without compromise.</p>



<p>Ultimately, curtains hold the power to transform your living space. Beyond their aesthetic value, they provide privacy, light control, and insulation. Whether you prefer floor-length elegance or modern grommet tops, your curtain selection should resonate with your style while complementing your room&#8217;s essence. By measuring accurately, considering your preferences, and choosing wisely, your curtains will contribute to a cozy and inviting atmosphere, turning your home into a haven of comfort and style.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"></h2>



<p>Step into the modern age of stylish entertaining and hospitality with in-home bars. Today, homeowners are embracing the revival of this classic trend to express their unique style and elevate their hosting prowess.</p>



<p>In the mid-20th century, in-home bars epitomized chic, sociable living, providing the perfect setting for cocktail parties and casual get-togethers. These days we&#8217;re witnessing a resurgence of the at-home bar.</p>



<p>The reasons for this revival are varied, such as the rising popularity of craft cocktails and microbreweries, which encourage aficionados to create their own inventive concoctions. Additionally, the lingering effects of the global pandemic have inspired the transformation of the home into <a href="https://fineartinteriors.com/portfolio/master-bedroom-coffee-wine-bar-remodel-the-canyons/">multifunctional spaces</a>, pushing us to seek ways to incorporate more entertainment elements.</p>



<p>This article will explore the growing trend of in-home bars and provide <a href="https://www.bhg.com/rooms/rooms/home-bar-ideas-281474979492034/">bar home ideas</a>. By the end, you&#8217;ll understand why they are reclaiming their place in modern homes and, perhaps, feel inspired to add one to your home.<br></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What is a home bar?</h2>



<p>A home bar is a dedicated space within a home designed to store and serve beverages. It often consists of storage for a variety of drinks, glassware, bar tools, a surface for mixing drinks, and sometimes seating options. Creating a bar in your home provides a canvas to showcase your unique style and uplevel your hosting game.</p>



<p><br>In terms of design and functionality, in-home bars can be categorized into two main types: wet bars and dry bars.<br><br>A wet bar’s setup has a sink with running water, a larger counter for preparing drinks, and often features built-in under-counter appliances like refrigerators or wine coolers.<br><br>A dry bar offers a convenient space without the need for a water supply and drain system. It offers storage for bottles, glassware, tools, and a surface to prepare drinks.  Dry bars do not require a standalone piece of furniture and can easily be integrated as a seamless part of any room.</p>



<p>Convenience is one of the major benefits of in-home bars. With a small home bar, your<br>favorite cocktail or brew is only a few steps away. It&#8217;s a wonderful spot for entertaining<br>guests. Moreover, a home bar setting can be a creative way to express personal style,<br>showcasing your taste.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="574" height="814" src="https://fineartinteriors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Picture1.jpg" alt="how to design a home bar" class="wp-image-9115" srcset="https://fineartinteriors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Picture1.jpg 574w, https://fineartinteriors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Picture1-212x300.jpg 212w" sizes="(max-width: 574px) 100vw, 574px" /></figure></div>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Types of in-home bars</h2>



<p>Just as homes come in various styles, so do in-home bars. The options include built-in bars, wooden bars, small bars, home mini bars, and freestanding bars.</p>



<p>A built-in bar is designed as part of the home&#8217;s architectural plan. It features cabinetry, countertops, and appliances to mimic a professional bar setup. A wooden bar offers a traditional and rustic feel, often crafted from solid wood with elaborate detailing.</p>



<p>A mini bar is perfect if your room is small or you prefer a minimalist design. It can be a stylish cabinet storing a curated collection of beverages. If you prefer flexibility, a freestanding bar is a great choice.</p>



<p>The style of an in-home bar depends on your lifestyle, personal taste, available space, and budget. It’s a fantastic way to carve out a space to relax both alone and with guests, as it can be customized to any size and decorated with tiles, wall hangings, and decorative pieces to create a unique vibe that aligns with your personal style.</p>



<p>A home bar should be easily accessible yet not obstruct regular movement. A bar cart is ideal if you have a very <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/budget-home-bar-ideas-7090583">tight budget</a> or limited room. It offers versatility and mobility and can add a vintage charm to your living room. You can adorn your <a href="https://www.hunker.com/13771143/sexy-bar-carts-we-are-coveting-big-time">bar cart</a> with your favorite spirits, glassware, an ice bucket, and other bar essentials.</p>



<p>When it comes to your budget, the amount you can invest will determine the size, features, and materials used in your bar&#8217;s construction. For instance, designing a built-in bar is a more comprehensive project involving plumbing (in the case of a wet bar), electrical wiring, and custom carpentry, thus requiring a larger budget. On the other hand, a dry bar setup such as a freestanding or mini bar requires less infrastructure, resulting in a more affordable alternative.</p>



<p>Similarly, the choice of materials will affect the overall cost. High-end finishes like marble countertops, bespoke woodwork, or premium appliances will significantly increase your budget compared to more modest alternatives.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Living room bars</h2>



<p>Bars for the living room are an excellent choice if you love to entertain in a casual yet stylish setting. This integration transforms your living room into a dynamic entertainment hub, making it easy for guests to mingle and enjoy a drink.</p>



<p>Some popular features of living room bars include minimalist cabinetry, floating shelves to showcase premium bottles, and integrated LED lighting. In terms of color schemes, darker tones like deep blues, grays, or black add a layer of sophistication.</p>



<p>One key benefit of a living room bar is the convenience and sociability it offers. Your guests are no longer confined to a kitchen island or dining table but can freely engage with each other in a relaxed setting.</p>



<p>Alternatively, you can opt for a mini bar in your living room for a more dedicated and compact option. Unlike a bar cart, a mini bar is a self-contained piece of furniture with specific storage for a limited selection of beverages and bar accessories. It provides a fixed and organized station for your drinks, ensuring everything is conveniently within reach.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="904" height="678" src="https://fineartinteriors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Picture4.jpg" alt="home bars in living room with a large arched window and glass chandelier and piano witih white flowers" class="wp-image-9117" srcset="https://fineartinteriors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Picture4.jpg 904w, https://fineartinteriors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Picture4-300x225.jpg 300w, https://fineartinteriors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Picture4-768x576.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 904px) 100vw, 904px" /></figure></div>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Dining room bar ideas</h2>



<p>Some dining room bar <a href="https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/home/decorating-ideas/g42485833/home-bar-ideas/">trends</a> include elegant designs to complement the formal dining atmosphere. Built-in credenzas, mirrored backsplashes, and glass-fronted cabinets are popular, adding a touch of glamor while showcasing your collection.</p>



<p>The primary advantage of a dining room bar is the smooth transition it provides between meals and after-dinner drinks. However, one potential downside could be the bar dominating the dining area, especially in smaller rooms, which could create a bottleneck in the flow of traffic to and from the kitchen or infringe on guests&#8217; personal space.</p>



<p>The room&#8217;s architectural layout must be considered when designing a dining room bar. For example, if the dining room is close to the kitchen, the bar might ideally be placed in the transition space, serving both areas efficiently.</p>



<p>A compact corner bar or a sleek sideboard turned into a drinks station can be an excellent solution for smaller rooms. A well-equipped bar cabinet or a freestanding bar can make a striking statement for larger rooms.</p>



<p>You can also turn your dining room into a bar area, where a section or the entire room becomes dedicated to the bar. This is particularly appealing if you frequently host social events.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Kitchen Bars</h2>



<p>Kitchen bars are a great solution for optimizing space while adding functionality and style. Kitchen bar designs range from built-in under-counter wine fridges to bespoke cocktail <a href="https://www.mydomaine.com/best-bar-cabinets-5087532">cabinets</a>.</p>



<p>One key advantage of a kitchen bar is that it promotes a more social atmosphere in the home, allowing people to enjoy each other&#8217;s company while cooking and dining. However, it&#8217;s important to consider possible limitations, like the size of the counter and potential clutter or spills that may cross over into your cooking area.</p>



<p>When creating a kitchen bar, prioritize organization and ease of access. A well-designed kitchen bar can significantly relieve congestion in front of the refrigerator by providing a dedicated space for your beverages. This smart setup effectively moves people away from the main refrigerator, especially during parties when guests tend to gravitate to the kitchen. Guests will appreciate having ease of access to a mix of additional non-alcoholic drinks inside a mini fridge.</p>



<p>Including a mini fridge within the kitchen bar provides convenient access to all drinks, reducing the need to access the main refrigerator frequently. Additionally, you can incorporate a coffee bar station into your kitchen bar, further dispersing congestion from the cooking area.</p>



<p>Other things you can install include a wine rack, drawer dividers for glassware, or even a small sink for washing barware. If you don’t have much room, a corner of your countertop can be transformed into a dedicated bar area, or you can opt for a kitchen wall bar &#8211; typically involving utilizing vertical space by installing open shelving, wall-mounted racks, or cabinets.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Bedroom Bars</h2>



<p>For some, having a bar in the bedroom might seem unconventional. Still, it&#8217;s an emerging trend that offers the luxury of enjoying a relaxing nightcap or fresh cup of coffee with your morning routine without having to leave the comfort of your bedroom. Bedroom bars feature compact setups with streamlined storage, open shelving, mini-fridges, and coffee machines.</p>



<p>Despite the benefits of convenience, a bedroom wet bar may have potential challenges like <a href="https://www.hgtv.com/design/remodel/interior-remodel/stylish-small-home-bar-ideas-pictures">space constraints</a> or the risk of spillages in the bedroom. However, there are several ways to accommodate this risk, such as using a bar mat, installing an arm rail, or placing a washable rug in front of the bar.<br>If you&#8217;re considering a bedroom bar, it&#8217;s essential to carefully plan the layout to ensure it blends seamlessly into your room without becoming obtrusive. Opt for sleek appliances that run quietly to avoid disrupting your peaceful retreat.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"></h2>



<p>In our fast-paced world, where time is precious, and trends are constantly changing, hiring an interior designer can bring immense value. While some individuals may possess a basic understanding of interior design, they may not have the specialized expertise to transform their spaces into vibrant reflections of their preferences.<br><br>This is where the knowledge and skills of an interior designer really shine. They have the extensive knowledge and experience to transform your vision into reality. Interior designers are highly proficient in design principles, space planning, knowledge of materials and finishes, and technical proficiency in software used to create detailed plans, layouts, and 3D visualizations.<br><br>Understanding the cost of interior design is crucial when you’re considering enlisting<br>professional help. In this article, we will shed light on the factors contributing to interior<br>design costs in Tucson, Arizona. We will explore the different components that impact the interior designer cost in Tucson, including the project scope, materials, labor, and other considerations.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="768" src="https://fineartinteriors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/IMG_8669-1024x768.jpg" alt="Interior designer blueprints on tablet" class="wp-image-9097" srcset="https://fineartinteriors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/IMG_8669-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://fineartinteriors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/IMG_8669-300x225.jpg 300w, https://fineartinteriors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/IMG_8669-768x576.jpg 768w, https://fineartinteriors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/IMG_8669-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://fineartinteriors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/IMG_8669-2048x1536.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Differences between an interior designer and an interior decorator</h2>



<p>Before we dive into the cost of hiring an interior designer in Tucson, AZ, it&#8217;s important to understand the distinction between an interior designer and an interior decorator. While these terms are sometimes used interchangeably, there are <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/interior-design-vs-interior-decorating-1976740">key differences</a> in their roles, qualifications, rates, and scope of work.<br>Interior designers have formal education and training in architecture, construction, and<br>design principles. They handle a space&#8217;s aesthetic and functional aspects, collaborating with clients to create layouts, select materials, and coordinate design elements. They also work with architects and contractors to ensure your vision is executed seamlessly.<br>On the other hand, interior decorators focus on enhancing the visual aspects of a space. They enhance the aesthetic appeal by selecting furniture, fabrics, accessories, color schemes, furniture arrangement, and finishing touches. Unlike an interior designer, a professional decorator doesn&#8217;t handle extensive structural changes or spatial planning. Additionally, formal training and a degree are not required for interior decorators.<br>Another significant difference between interior designers and interior decorators is the<br>pricing. Interior designers often have higher <a href="https://www.forbes.com/home-improvement/contractor/cost-to-hire-interior-designer/#:~:text=Most%20interior%20designers%20charge%20for,including%20the%20cost%20of%20furniture.">hourly rates</a> due to their comprehensive training and ability to handle complex projects.</p>



<p>When it comes to interior decorator costs, the pricing structures are more affordable and cater to clients with smaller budgets or projects requiring quick makeovers.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="675" src="https://fineartinteriors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Blog-1-Image-2-1024x675.jpg" alt="how much does an interior designer cost in az" class="wp-image-9098" srcset="https://fineartinteriors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Blog-1-Image-2-1024x675.jpg 1024w, https://fineartinteriors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Blog-1-Image-2-300x198.jpg 300w, https://fineartinteriors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Blog-1-Image-2-768x507.jpg 768w, https://fineartinteriors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Blog-1-Image-2-1536x1013.jpg 1536w, https://fineartinteriors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Blog-1-Image-2-2048x1351.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How much does an interior designer cost?</h2>



<p>Several factors influence the interior designer cost in Tucson, AZ. Here are the key<br>considerations:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Experience and Reputation</strong>: Highly experienced and reputable interior designers<br>often charge higher fees due to their expertise and track record of successful<br>projects.</li>



<li><strong>Professional Credentials</strong>: Interior designers with <a href="https://www.houzz.com/pro-learn/blog/startup-guide-interior-design-best-certificate-programs">advanced certifications</a>, like those from the National Council for Interior Design Qualification (NCIDQ), American Society of Interior Designers (ASID), International Interior Design Association (IIDA), Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) or Certified Interior Designer (CID) may have higher rates.</li>



<li><strong>Scope of the Project</strong>: The size and complexity of the project affect the cost, with<br>extensive renovations or large-scale designs requiring more resources and expertise.</li>



<li><strong>Design Services Required</strong>: The specific design services needed, such as space<br>planning, furniture selection, and overseeing the project, contribute to the overall<br>cost.</li>



<li><strong>Location</strong>: Designers in larger cities or high-cost areas may charge more than those in smaller towns with lower overhead expenses.</li>



<li><strong>Timeframe</strong>: Tight deadlines or projects requiring expedited work may incur additional charges due to increased resources and overtime labor.</li>



<li><strong>Additional Expenses</strong>: These include the cost of materials, furnishings, fixtures, and any subcontractors required for the project.</li>
</ul>



<p>Interior designers in Tucson typically charge between $90 and $300 per hour or more, depending on the scope of your project. To budget effectively for your project:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Assess the scope and scale of your project: Determine whether your project is small, medium, or large by considering its level of complexity. Identifying the size of your project will help you gauge the amount of resources and budget required.</li>



<li>Research average costs: Look into interior designer cost estimates and the average costs associated with similar projects in your area. This will give you a general idea of the price range you can expect.</li>



<li>Obtain multiple quotes: Reach out to several interior designers and request quotes based on your project&#8217;s specific requirements. By obtaining multiple quotes, you can compare costs to ensure you are getting a fair and competitive price.</li>



<li>Prioritize your needs: Determine your must-haves and prioritize them within your budget. This will help you allocate funds to the most essential aspects of your project while keeping an eye on costs.</li>



<li>Maintain open communication: Clearly communicate your budget limitations and expectations to your chosen interior designer. Consider sharing a budget range rather than a fixed amount, as it provides more flexibility. By establishing open and honest communication, you can work together to find creative solutions that fit within your budget without compromising on quality.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How do interior designers charge?</h2>



<p>Interior designers use various <a href="https://www.bhg.com/how-much-does-an-interior-designer-cost-7197775">pricing models</a> to determine their rates. Here are the common pricing structures used in the industry:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Hourly Rate</strong>: Interior designers charge an hourly fee for their services. This model offers transparency as you pay for the actual time spent on the project.</li>



<li><strong>Flat Rate Fees</strong>: Designers provide a fixed fee for the entire project based on its scope and complexity. This model offers clarity upfront, allowing you to budget more accurately. Usually based on square footage. Interior designers in Tucson typically charge between $10-$17 a square foot for construction-related services and between $17-$24 if you add furnishings and accessories.</li>



<li><strong>Cost-Plus</strong>: With the cost-plus model, interior designers charge the actual cost of materials, furnishings, and services, along with an additional percentage as their fee. This approach provides transparency, as you can see the cost breakdown.</li>



<li><strong>Percentage of Total Budget</strong>: Interior designers charge a percentage fee based on the total budget allocated for the project. This model aligns the designer&#8217;s compensation with the project&#8217;s scale and complexity.</li>
</ul>



<p>These pricing models have advantages and disadvantages:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Interior design hourly rates offer transparency but can be challenging to estimate the final cost, especially for projects with unpredictable timelines.</li>



<li>Flat rate fees provide clarity but may not account for changes or additional work required along the way.</li>



<li>Cost-plus offers transparency but can result in higher costs as the designer&#8217;s fee increases along with the project expenses.</li>



<li>The percentage of the total budget aligns with the compensation but may lack flexibility for projects with fluctuating budgets.</li>
</ul>



<p>If your project is small, the most suitable pricing model would be:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Hourly Rate: You only pay for the actual time spent on the project allowing you to have more control over the budget track hours and expenses incurred.</li>
</ul>



<p>If your project is bigger, the cost-plus or percentage of total budget models may be more suitable:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Cost-Plus: With larger projects, there is often a significant amount of materials, furnishings, and services involved. The cost-plus model allows you to see the cost</li>



<li>breakdown for these components.</li>



<li>Percentage of Total Budget: By charging a percentage fee based on the overall budget allocated for the project, this model aligns the interior designer&#8217;s fee with the scale and complexity of the project.</li>



<li>Flat Rate: You pay a fixed rate for the entire project, allowing you to budget more accurately since you know the total cost from the beginning.</li>
</ul>



<p>When choosing a pricing model for your project, consider the size and complexity of the project as well as your budget limitations. Additionally, evaluate your preference for transparency in costs, control over expenses, and the level of clarity you need regarding upfront costs.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What&#8217;s luxury or bespoke home interior design?</h2>



<p>Luxury or bespoke home interior design focuses on creating a high-end, custom-made<br>space. Luxury interior designers have a deep understanding of high-end interior design<br>trends and can create spaces that effortlessly blend style and functionality.<br><br>Luxury home interior design is often characterized by the following factors:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Premium materials</strong>: Luxury interior designers often use premium materials, such as marble, granite, and exotic woods. These elements can infuse any space with a touch of luxury and sophistication.</li>



<li><strong>High-end finishes</strong>: These include gold leaf, crystal, and hand-painted finishes. These finishes can add a touch of glamour and opulence.</li>



<li><strong>Specialized contractors and expert artisans</strong>: Luxury interior designers often work with specialized contractors and expert artisans to create custom pieces for their clients. This can include everything from custom furniture to handcrafted sculptures.</li>
</ul>



<p>Due to these factors, the interior designer’s cost for luxury home interior design can be notably higher when incorporating exclusive hand-crafted elements instead of using more mainstream pieces.</p>



<p>Luxury home interior designers must stay committed to apprising themselves of  current trends and innovations. To this end, luxury interior designers usually attend several trade shows annually. This allows them to remain updated on the latest technologies, finishes, and overall design aesthetics, ensuring they can always provide the most cutting-edge and exclusive designs.</p>



<p>When searching for a luxury home interior designer in Tucson, finding someone with a portfolio that truly captivates you is crucial. You should also interview several designers before making a decision.</p>

<p><em>Hiring an interior designer in the pre-construction phase can save everyone time and ensure a&nbsp;well-planned home, from ceiling height to outlet placement.&nbsp;</em></p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>When Should I Hire an Interior Designer?</strong>&nbsp;</h4>



<p>If you think interior designers are only responsible for the final flourishes after your architect and&nbsp; builder have created the blank canvas, spoiler alert: ​You’re missing the opportunity to make the&nbsp; most of your design investment and add those personalized features that make your space feel&nbsp; more yours.&nbsp;<br><strong>Before construction begins, interior designers review blueprints and floor plans, and see the&nbsp;potential of a particular wall or area of your new home.&nbsp;<br></strong>We can look at your walk-in closet and anticipate where you’re going to need built-in storage for&nbsp;your impressive shoe collection…&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Show your builder where you need a discreet outlet for that wall-mounted TV or light fixture in&nbsp;your home office above where your desk will be, so the wiring is done right the first time…&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>And turn wasted space into ​a master bedroom breakfast bar​ where you can savor a&nbsp; freshly-brewed cup in the morning ​before​ the kids start clinging to your appendages and sharing&nbsp; their snot with your freshly steamed work shirt.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>There are so many decisions that go into building a home, and many of them need to be made before the hammers come out and the flooring gets installed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Here are 3 reasons why hiring an interior designer before a builder can help you make smarter&nbsp; design decisions from the outset, so you can avoid surprise costs and frustrating delays during&nbsp; your <a href="https://fineartinteriors.com/services/">remodel or new build project</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left"><strong>1. A Designer is Your Liaison to Your Builder and Architect<br></strong>Building a house or planning a remodel is a big job. Having a team of  professionals that can&nbsp;collaborate from day one is the best way to keep things moving and on schedule, account for&nbsp;your must-have design features before building begins, and avoid backtracking construction.&nbsp;<br><strong>Hiring an interior designer gives you a voice at the table and someone who knows your&nbsp;Pinterest mood board inside-out. We spend time on-site, ensuring your architect’s vision is&nbsp;reflected in your home’s interior and anticipating problems before they have a chance to&nbsp;become headaches.&nbsp;<br></strong>You can count on us to advocate for your needs at every stage of the construction process,&nbsp;saving you the stress of dealing with contractor-speak and unanswered voicemails. And that&nbsp;means no more losing sleep over contractors taking liberties with your budget or shortcuts that&nbsp;cheap out on your functional needs and personal style.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">An interior designer can also discuss scale changes with your architect to create furniture&nbsp; arrangements that maximize your views or make it easier for you to keep an eye on your kids&nbsp; when they’re playing cannonball-on-each-other’s-heads in the pool.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>From designing skylights in rooms where natural light is lacking and making suggestions for&nbsp;where plumbing and heating need to be rerouted, hiring an interior designer pre-construction&nbsp;ensures your home is a cohesive masterpiece that feels completely tailored to your living habits.&nbsp;<br>Without this kind of expert foresight, you risk having a <a href="https://fineartinteriors.com/galleries/">living room</a> layout where your furniture&nbsp; feels too squished or there’s a constant glare that disrupts your viewing pleasure of The Bachelor&nbsp; thanks to a careless window placement.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>Diagram One: This is the original kitchen layout a builder suggested for one of my clients</em></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="661" src="https://fineartinteriors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Blog-Kitchen-1-1024x661.png" alt="tucson interior designer" class="wp-image-8874" srcset="https://fineartinteriors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Blog-Kitchen-1-1024x661.png 1024w, https://fineartinteriors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Blog-Kitchen-1-300x194.png 300w, https://fineartinteriors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Blog-Kitchen-1-768x496.png 768w, https://fineartinteriors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Blog-Kitchen-1.png 1078w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">3D renderings purposed to client during our Concept &amp; Planning Phase&nbsp;</figcaption></figure>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="900" height="630" src="https://fineartinteriors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/K_MG_0063.jpg" alt="interior design companies tucson az" class="wp-image-8690" srcset="https://fineartinteriors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/K_MG_0063.jpg 900w, https://fineartinteriors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/K_MG_0063-300x210.jpg 300w, https://fineartinteriors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/K_MG_0063-768x538.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Photograph of actual finished kitchen</figcaption></figure>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>Diagram 2: This is the new kitchen layout I designed for the same client after they hired me&nbsp;</em></p>



<p><strong>2. Make Your Design Investment Last<br></strong>Regardless of how much you’re ready to invest in <a href="https://fineartinteriors.com/">your dream home</a>, you want a home that’s built&nbsp; to last. If you decide you like the high-end look and reasonable price of those brass faucets for&nbsp;your bathroom, your builder will probably give you the old head nod and move forward without&nbsp;informing you of your options.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>On the other hand, an interior designer will let you know that brass may be more&nbsp;high-maintenance than a metal like polished nickel, so you feel more confident in the decisions&nbsp; you’re making and the long-term impact they’ll have on your home. (We’ll also talk you out of&nbsp;those Zebra striped kitchen cabinets…because that’s what true friends do.)&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><strong>An interior designer not only professionally manages your budget and carefully curates every&nbsp;detail of your home, but we help you decide where investing in beauty or convenience may be worth it, like motorizing some of your larger window coverings.<br></strong>As an expert in sourcing materials, your interior designer will also know exactly where to find what you’re looking for and how to get quality workmanship without breaking the bank.&nbsp;<br><strong>Hiring an interior designer is not only going to build you a home that&#8217;s beautiful, but also built to last.</strong></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="900" height="600" src="https://fineartinteriors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/K_MG_5674.jpg" alt="should you hire an interior designer before a builder" class="wp-image-8701" srcset="https://fineartinteriors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/K_MG_5674.jpg 900w, https://fineartinteriors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/K_MG_5674-300x200.jpg 300w, https://fineartinteriors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/K_MG_5674-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Modern twist on a classic white bathroom with gold accents</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>3. Form Should Always Follow Function</strong><br>Not only do interior designers keep your big vision in mind for how things will come together in&nbsp; the end, but they also obsess over the small details that are easy for untrained eyes to miss&nbsp; because they recognize they’ll have a big impact on how your home functions.&nbsp;<br><strong>The last thing you want is a master bedroom with zero space for bedside tables or a home&nbsp;office where the only outlet to plug your computer into is 7 feet away from your desk. This is&nbsp;where hiring an interior designer ​before​ a builder helps you avoid costly redesigns and&nbsp;change orders.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></strong>Unlike builders, interior designers recognize that every single decision has a domino effect on&nbsp;the rest of your space. That means room dimensions should be dictated by the layout you want,&nbsp;not the other way around. Electrical outlets, AC-registers, and plumbing all need to be&nbsp;pre-planned to accommodate furniture placement and create better flow in your space.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="692" src="https://fineartinteriors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/K_MG_5712-1024x692.jpg" alt="interior design firms tucson" class="wp-image-8706" srcset="https://fineartinteriors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/K_MG_5712-1024x692.jpg 1024w, https://fineartinteriors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/K_MG_5712-300x203.jpg 300w, https://fineartinteriors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/K_MG_5712-768x519.jpg 768w, https://fineartinteriors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/K_MG_5712-1536x1038.jpg 1536w, https://fineartinteriors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/K_MG_5712-2048x1384.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Modern Bedroom in warm, neutral colors</figcaption></figure>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading">An interior designer finds creative ways to accommodate your current lifestyle while also planning for your family’s future needs, so you can&nbsp;create a space you love that functions exactly the way you need it to.&nbsp;</h5>

<p>&#8220;Our very large scale remodel and addition project was overwhelming until we found Kimberly, who instantly put us at ease. She helped us with communication issues with our contractor and <strong>took the remodel experience from one of anxiety and anguish to one of excitement and relief.</strong> We trusted her opinions and appreciated her fairness and professionalism. She helped us choose high quality workmanship but at the same time saved us so much money. Her personality made everything so much fun, and we had the ultimate trust in her opinions, fairness and professionalism. We even trusted her opinion when she thought we should spend a little bit more money for beauty or convenience in the long run – such as motorizing some of our larger window coverings. She was always right!”<br>-Dr. A Chandler- University of Arizona</p>
